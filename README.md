# Face Recognition Module for Windows
This repository used `face_recognition module` from 
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition. There is an working version
for `linux` in that repository. But for <b>`windows user`</b> the 
installation has been so difficult. We tried to solve this issue 
by providing **pre-built whl** in the repository and install from them.The two modules are:-

<code>dlib module: dlib-19.8.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl</code>
<code>face-recognition module: face_recognition-1.2.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl </code>

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.And then
run
<code>python install.py</code>. And then you can use **face_recognition
module in Windows**. After you install please follow the documentation
given in this awesome repository: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition and use it.

For ease of use there is already a code for face recognition from video input.
Both faster and slower method with low and high accuracy. If you want to test it
out please follow below documentation.
